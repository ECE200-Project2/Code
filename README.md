In this project, we impliment Mips ISA using C. In the main loop, we first decode opcode and devide the instruction into 
function R_type, J type, Branch type, immediate type, load store type. In each function, we decode the rest of the instruction
and make C execute the program. 

Yichen implemented Branch type, immediate type, load store type.

Shuohong implemented R type and J type.
